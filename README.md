# Rail Fence Cipher (My Terragon Snack for Dessert)!

An implementation of a type of Transposition Cipher encryption algorithms

###### This code was completed during 90 minutes of Terragon's snap recruitment test.
It uses Caesar Cipher and Rail Fence Cipher, a variation of Transposition cipher, to encrypt some given texts.
The Caesar Cipher only works when the encrypted form of the Rail Fence Cipher is exactly the same as the word to be encrypted.
This makes it a bit more difficult to decrypt but it surely can brutef-forced too!
