# Caeser Cipher + Rail Fence Cipher
My Terragon Snack for Dessert!

This code uses Caesar Cipher and Rail Fence Cipher, a variation of Transposition cipher, to encrypt some given texts.
The Caesar Cipher only works when the encrypted form of the Rail Fence Cipher is exactly the same as the word to be encrypted.
This makes it a bit more difficult to decrypt but it surely can brutef-forced too!
